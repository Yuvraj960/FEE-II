        <h2>Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury</h2>
        <p>Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel set in a future where books are banned and "firemen" burn any that are
            found. The story follows Montag, a fireman who becomes disillusioned with his role in a society devoid of
            knowledge and creativity. As he begins to question the status quo, he discovers the importance of literature
            and the profound impact it has on individuals and society as a whole.</p>
